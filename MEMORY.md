# THE BORING TEK — MEMORY.md

Running log of decisions and current state. Read before any work. Update after every
session that changes state or makes a decision. Public repo — no secrets, no client
names in here either.

## Status

- Phase: **site v1 is BUILT, not shipped.** The coming soon page is gone. `index.html`
  is now the real site: two themes, three languages, a mascot with a speech bubble, and
  a multi-step contact form.
- **Blocking ship:** the Cloudflare Worker at
  `boring-tek-forms.theboringtek.workers.dev` still has to be deployed. The web3forms
  key is in place, so email delivery works on its own and a send will already succeed
  without the Worker — the Telegram half just stays silent until it is up. Nothing else
  blocks.
- **Neither endpoint has been called for real.** Both were only ever exercised against a
  stubbed network. The first live send is still unproven.
- **v1 has been rendered and measured in headless Chrome** at 320px and 1440px, in both
  themes and all three languages. Verified: no horizontal scroll anywhere; all 33 bubble
  lines across EN/RU/LV fit with no clipping left, right or top; the card unfold
  animates and the inner spring overshoots and settles; the theme cross-fade moves
  background, mascot face, mascot eyes and the phosphor glow together over ~500ms; the
  CTA glitches ~5 times in 22s and goes silent when the form opens; the mascot blinks
  ~4 times in 22s and keeps blinking while wide-eyed; idle chatter is correctly gated
  while the form is open; the whole form works end to end under `prefers-reduced-motion`
  including validation; restart fully resets. No JS errors in any pass.
- **Both submit destinations were tested against all four outcomes** with a stubbed
  network: both up, web3forms only, worker only, and both down. One surviving delivers
  the form and shows the check mark; only both failing shows the red line, with the send
  button re-enabled and every answer still in place. The send button is genuinely
  `disabled` and carries the `.busy` breathe while in flight, the worker payload carries
  no `access_key`, and the console stays silent in all four cases.
- **Still unchecked:** real devices, real fonts on non-Chrome engines, Safari and
  Firefox, screen readers, and keyboard-only navigation. The rest of the "Before
  shipping" checklist in `skills/page-builder/SKILL.md` still applies.
- Site is a single static file served by GitHub Pages from `main` root. Push to `main`
  is the deploy — there is no staging, so check the diff before every push.
- Everything through 2026-08-21 is committed and pushed. **Uncommitted right now:** the
  whole v1 rebuild — `index.html`, `skills/page-builder/SKILL.md` and this file.

## Current state

### Site

- **Domain:** theboringtek.com — live on GitHub Pages.
- **DNS:** done at Hostinger, pointed at GitHub Pages. `CNAME` in repo root holds the
  apex domain.
- **Repo:** github.com/einzxx/boring-tek, public.
- **Live page** — site v1, one file, ~53KB, one external request at load (Michroma):
  - **Two themes.** Light is the default: white page, near-black mascot face with white
    eyes, no phosphor glow. Dark is the old look: near-black page, white face, dark
    eyes, green bloom on the headline. Toggle top right, saved in `localStorage` under
    `bt-theme`, every colour cross-fading over 0.5s.
  - **Three languages.** EN / RU / LV as plain text buttons top left, saved under
    `bt-lang`. Every visible string lives in one `T` object; switching re-renders the
    current view in place without losing form progress.
  - Mascot at ~110px, eyes tracking the cursor, blinking on its own, soft halo behind
    him. He is also a button — pressing him opens the form.
  - **Speech bubble** off his top right: three dots climbing diagonally, then a pill.
    Bored lines every 8–14s while idle; dry comments between form steps; a permanent
    line after send.
  - Michroma wordmark, one-shot decode on load, three-line stacked lockup under 640px.
  - Subline types itself once, then static. Michroma for EN, drops to mono for RU and LV
    because Michroma has no Cyrillic and no Latvian diacritics.
  - **CTA button** — bordered pill, "tell us what you need", shaking with an rgb split
    on the text every 3–5s to ask for attention. Fills solid on hover.
  - **Contact form** — unfolds under the lockup, one question per step, four paths,
    inline validation, and on send `POST`s the same readable JSON to two places at
    once — web3forms for email and our own Cloudflare Worker for Telegram.
  - CRT grain and radial vignette in both themes, at different weights.
- **Favicon:** the mascot, transparent background, no plate, inline data URI. Still the
  dark-mode colourway (white face, dark eyes) — a favicon can't know the page theme.
- **SEO:** unchanged from the coming soon page. `<title>`, meta description, canonical,
  og:title / og:description / og:url / og:type, twitter:card=summary. `color-scheme` is
  now `light dark` and `theme-color` is updated by JS on every theme switch — those two
  are part of the theme system, not the SEO block.
- **`robots.txt`** (root) — allows everything, points at the sitemap.
- **`sitemap.xml`** (root) — one url, `https://theboringtek.com/`. No `lastmod`.
- **Project files:** CLAUDE.md, MEMORY.md, skills/, assets/ — all tracked.

### Socials

- Dressed and consistent: mascot as the avatar and **THE BORING TEK** as the name
  everywhere. Same face, same wordmark, no per-platform variation.
- Banners delivered for **X, Facebook and YouTube**.
- **Bio line, locked:** `the future is cool. building it is boring.`
  Use it verbatim everywhere a bio is asked for. Do not reword, do not "improve" it.

## Decisions

### Site v1 — 2026-08-22

- **Light mode is the default theme, dark is the identity.** Both ship, neither is a
  degraded version of the other. First-time visitors get light; we deliberately do not
  read `prefers-color-scheme`, because a chosen default beats a guess and the toggle is
  one press away. Dark is where the phosphor look lives and it is what the socials and
  the favicon still use.
- **The mascot inverts with the theme** — face `--face`, eyes `--eye`, and `--eye` is
  always the page background. That invariant is why he can invert at all: he reads as a
  hole punched in the page, so he never needs an outline. Adding one would be a
  different mascot.
- **Light mode gets its own green.** `#35ff6a` measures under 2:1 on white. Light uses
  `#0f8a3c`, the same hue walked down until it passes. One green for both themes is not
  a shortcut, it is an unreadable page.
- **Glow is a dark-mode effect.** In light the headline is flat with no bloom. There is
  no such thing as a light-mode phosphor glow; on white it is a smudge.
- **Three rules from the old spec were deliberately lifted**, in named scopes only:
  rounded corners (three radii, for things you press or things that speak), spring
  overshoot easing (`cubic-bezier(.34,1.4,.64,1)`, never on colour), and shake (the CTA
  glitch only). They were banned for a page whose job was to sit still. A form has to
  feel like it answers back. They are not widened beyond those scopes.
- **The headline lost its blinking caret.** The CTA glitch is now the page's one
  attention-getter and two blinking things fight each other. If a caret is ever wanted
  back, the glitch comes off first.
- **The subline drops to mono for RU and LV.** Michroma is Latin-only, so a per-glyph
  fallback would split a word across two faces. All or nothing, tested on the string.
- **The form payload is always English**, built from the `en` dictionary, plus a
  `language` field recording what the visitor actually used. An inbox you can't read is
  worse than no inbox.
- **The contact route is two destinations, fired in parallel.** This answers the open
  question from the coming soon phase, and **Formspree is gone — do not reintroduce it.**
  1. **web3forms** — `https://api.web3forms.com/submit`, email. Takes `access_key` and
     a `subject` of `new form — the boring tek`, then the readable fields.
  2. **our own Cloudflare Worker** — `https://boring-tek-forms.theboringtek.workers.dev`,
     Telegram. The same readable fields, **no access key**, never send it one.

  Both go out together under `Promise.allSettled`, and **one arriving counts as sent**.
  The red `could not send. try again.` line only appears when both fail. Nobody should
  have to retype a form because one mail relay was down.
- **The web3forms access key is public by design and belongs in the page.** It is a
  write-only submission token, not a credential — it can only push a form into our
  inbox. It is not covered by the no-secrets rule, and it does not need hiding, proxying
  or an env var. The Worker holds the actual Telegram bot token, server side, where it
  belongs.
- **A fetch that resolves with a 4xx still fulfils**, so each POST checks `r.ok` and
  throws. Without that, `allSettled` reads a rejected submission as a delivery and the
  visitor gets a check mark for a form nobody received.
- **The payload is never logged**, not even in a `catch`. It carries a name, a business
  and an email address.
- Nothing fetches on load, so the "one external request at load" rule still holds.
- **The mascot is a second way into the form.** He is the most clickable thing on the
  page; only wiring the button was the bug.
- **The one `<script>` moved into `<head>` and is not deferred.** It applies the saved
  theme and language synchronously as its first act. Deferring it puts a white flash in
  front of every dark-mode visitor.
- **The theme cross-fade survives `prefers-reduced-motion`.** The reduced override is no
  longer a blanket `transition: none` — it narrows `transition-property` to the four
  colour properties. A colour fade is not vestibular motion, and snapping the whole page
  between white and near-black is the harsher of the two options.
- **The subline's blur duplicate was removed.** It had to be written in the same frame
  as the core all through the typing or it trailed a white ghost, and on a white page it
  was pure cost. `--sub` carries the line on its own.
- **The amber ramp is retired.** Nothing was using it. Green is the only accent.
- **Six non-obvious fixes came out of actually rendering the page**, all now written up
  in `skills/page-builder/SKILL.md`. Worth knowing they exist before touching the bubble
  or the card: the bubble needs `width: max-content` or the pill wraps at any width; the
  pill's horizontal shift must be a negative margin, not a transform, or the page
  scrolls sideways and `overflow-x: clip` will not save it; the pill's position and its
  entrance scale must be separate CSS properties or the correction inherits the spring
  and lags; the pill clamps below the top bar, not to the viewport edge, so it never
  covers the theme toggle; the fit has to re-run when the card resizes, because the
  unfold lifts the head after the line was placed; and a transition class added in the
  same frame `display: none` came off does not animate — it needs two rAFs.

### Earlier — 2026-08-21

- Static coming soon page first, full agency site later in the same repo. **Closed —
  v1 replaced it.**
- Single file, zero dependencies, no build step. In force until explicitly lifted.
- `index.html` and `CNAME` live in the repo root permanently. Pages depends on both.
- Repo stays public, so no secrets and no client names in any tracked file, ever.
  Anonymised case studies only.
- Brand voice: raw, anti-corporate, terminal-native. Lowercase, no emoji, no corporate
  filler.
- Services scoped to three: custom AI agents, backend infrastructure, workflow
  automation.
- Headline face is Michroma (Google Fonts), the single external request the site makes
  at load. Single weight 400 — no bold exists, never fake one. Mono for everything else.
- Headline caps at 2.75rem, uniform on desktop and in the stacked mobile lockup. It
  should sit as one elegant centred line with air around it, not wall to wall.
- Mascot, headline and subline are one `.lockup` block, centred as a group. Never loose
  siblings sharing a wrapper gap. (v1 added the CTA and the card to that block.)
- Mascot: **variant 5, tired eyes, FINAL.** Do not redesign. See below.
- **Only the mascot reacts to the pointer.** The headline and subline are fully static —
  no lean, no translate, no brightening on mouse move. An earlier build had the whole
  lockup leaning and brightening; that was removed on purpose. One thing reacting reads
  as a character noticing you; everything reacting reads as a gimmick.
- Subline is uppercase, tracked `.18em`, dim neutral **with no green in it**. Two glowing
  green lines stacked read as one block of glow and cost the headline its hierarchy.
- Caps are set with `text-transform`, not typed into the markup. **The catch:** canvas
  `measureText` ignores CSS, so any width measurement has to uppercase the string itself
  or it comes out ~15% short.
- `--tu` is measured on a canvas, not guessed. Michroma is proportional and `.18em`
  tracking is heavy. v1 re-measures it on every language switch.
- **Bio line locked:** `the future is cool. building it is boring.` Verbatim everywhere.
- Socials carry the mascot as avatar and THE BORING TEK as the name on every platform.
- Basic SEO added: head meta, `robots.txt` and `sitemap.xml` in root. Two top-level
  files, both required to sit in root by convention.
- `twitter:card` is `summary`, not `summary_large_image`. There is no card image.

## Mascot — variant 5, tired eyes, FINAL

A **soft circle face with two flat rounded-rectangle eyes sitting low on the face**,
wider than tall. Heavy, bored, unbothered. Nothing else — no mouth, no nose, no body,
no outline, no shading.

Locked 2026-08-21. Variant 5 is the official face. Earlier variants (the pixel bot, then
the tall vertical-dash face) are superseded and gone. Do not redesign.

### Files

- `assets/mascot.png` — original art, the reference.
- `assets/mascot.svg` — the vector on a 64×64 grid. Source of truth; everything else is
  cut from it. Transparent, neutral pose, white face and dark eyes.
- `assets/mascot-left.svg`, `-right.svg`, `-up-left.svg`, `-up-right.svg` — pose
  variants, eyes slid toward that side. The up poses add a 4° tilt. Only the eye group
  moves; the face never does. Saved for future use, not referenced by the site.
- The standalone files and the favicon stay **white face on dark eyes** — the dark-mode
  colourway. They are used as avatars on dark surfaces, and a favicon can't know the
  page theme. Only the in-page mascot inverts.

### On the site

- The mascot is at the top of the lockup, ~110px, centred, with a soft halo behind him
  and clear space beneath. He is a character, not an icon.
- **He is also the second entry point to the contact form** — `role="button"`,
  keyboard-reachable, and pressing him does exactly what the CTA does.
- **Eyes follow the cursor** on desktop, from anywhere on screen. Capped at ±6 and ±3.8
  user units by construction, which is what keeps them on the face. Tracking stops while
  the form is open.
- **Blinks every 4–6s** with randomness, eyes squash flat for ~120ms. Both eyes, snap
  not fade.
- **Eyes go wide when the form opens** (`--wide: 2.2`), back to normal on restart. It
  multiplies the same `scaleY` the blink uses, so he can still blink while surprised.
  **The shared transition must stay under 120ms** or the blink silently stops working.
- **Touch and reduced motion: eyes centred, blink only.** The blink is the one
  deliberate reduced-motion exception on this site.
- Colours are token-driven: face `--face`, eyes `--eye`, and `--eye` always equals the
  page background.

Exact geometry, the proportion table, the variant transforms and the do-not-do list live
in `skills/page-builder/SKILL.md` → Mascot. That file is the source of truth.

## Next steps

1. **Deploy the Cloudflare Worker** at `boring-tek-forms.theboringtek.workers.dev`. The
   web3forms key is already in, so email works without it; the Telegram half is silent
   until it ships.
2. **Send one real test form** and confirm it lands. Both endpoints have only been
   tested against a stubbed network — the first live send is unproven.
3. **Run the "Before shipping" checklist** in `skills/page-builder/SKILL.md`. It is
   written for v1 and every visual check has to be run in both themes. Nothing here has
   been seen in a browser yet.
4. Have the EN, RU and LV copy corrected. The translations are natural but written by
   Claude, not by a native speaker, and Einz said corrections would come later.
5. Decide whether the site links out to the socials now that there is a real page to
   link from.
6. **Milestone: social content rhythm** — cadence, pillars, a reusable post format.
   Posts now have somewhere to point, which was the open question blocking it.

## Open questions

- Social handles aren't recorded here and aren't linked from the site. Write them down.
- Business email to publish — still not decided. The form is now the contact route, so
  this is no longer blocking, but a real address is still worth having.
- Whether the full site stays single-file as it grows past v1. Default: stays
  single-file until it genuinely can't.
- Whether to ship an `og:image`. Needs a real hosted PNG (1200×630). That means a binary
  in the repo — decide before adding one. **Now also needs a theme decision:** which
  version of the mascot goes on the card.
- Whether to register the site in Google Search Console and submit the sitemap.
- Whether the light or the dark screenshot is the one that goes on the socials.

## Not committed / lives elsewhere

- **Social banners** for X, Facebook and YouTube — delivered, not in this repo.
- Brand image assets (`BT.png`, headers, earlier mascot renders) sit in
  `~/Downloads/Boring TEK files/`. Not committed — decide format and whether inline SVG
  can replace them before adding any binary.
- `assets/` in the repo holds only the mascot: `mascot.png` (reference), `mascot.svg`
  (source of truth) and the four pose variants.
